####Project Brief Description:
the project is actually a web application built for a client. This web application is basically a replica of tipico.com.
using this web application a user can register and make his/her profile. The main usage of this web application is for 
betting purposes. Every Time a dashboard is displayed showing the rate and statistics of different betting generated by 
users or of games. users can view that betting statistics and can choose to bit on anything of their own choice. Moreover
there is chat module using which users can make chat rooms and can chat one to one.

####SpotProphets Testing

#####Tools Used:
- AB Apache
- Load Runner

This Web application was tested for 50-60 users at once.But it was supposed to run for atlead 100 users.



####Challenges
| Challenge     | How it was Solved?|
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| The data was continuously updated from an API named Bet-radar. Continuous match feed was received through this API calls because of this there were too many Ajax calls that put too much load on the server.      |This issue was solved by dividing the Database into two portions one is used for read and write and another is used for reading only. One data comes into the system it is written on a database after that replicated on another database that supports only read operations.Users can read data only from the read database. |
| Chat module was another big challenge in this project. For a huge number of users it was very difficult to manage all the users and their chats. Again in this case they were making too many Ajax calls. So is the case with development of chat rooms.     | This issue was solved by opening a new socket on very conversation. This enabled the developers to reduce the ajax calls and thus reducing the amount of ajax calls and lowering the load on server.|
| The algorithm that was used for the purpose of generating combinations of bets was taking too long for that purpose.  | Initially the nested loops were 250 in iterations that was brought down to 18. Thus increasing the efficiency of the algorithm      |
 



####Better Approach for Project
Team lead of this project Mr. Imran Khan is of the opinion that this web application is taking too long for simple operation that can be improved by Node.js instead of Zend 1 framework because Zend loads all the libraries inspite of the fact that whether it needs them or not.
