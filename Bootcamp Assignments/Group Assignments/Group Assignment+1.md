###Brief History of Coeus:
The journey to build Coeus was started back in 2003 when five Computer Science students participated in Computer 
Society's annual International Design Competition (CSIDC). Though this team of five students were not among the 
top ten teams but on the basis of their efforts of five to six months they decided to start a company named 
Uraan Software Solutions. Later on the name was changed to Coeus Solutions GmBH. At the start of the company 
most of the projects were gained from elance website. From 2007 to 2009 company was outsourcing projects. 
Coeus was started in LUMS Computer Science labs and since then, apart from Lahore, coeus have grown to have
offices in Berlin (the Headquarters), Munich, Paris, London, and Palo Alto. Its customers include, some 
of the most well-recognized and largest brands in Europe & the US. For example, one of Coeus customers 
QYPE is the largest location based service in entire Europe.Apart from regular customers, Coeus also run 
a venture incubator. Coeus got in touch with germany in 2008, because 2007 and 2008 were very active years 
for online business in Germany. This made a big demand of web developers and since Coeus Solutions offered good and 
high quality services at a very competitive pricing. So, company started growing and became quickly famous and successful. 
Now Coeus Solutions has only two partners.Using the success in Germany Coeus Solutions expanded to France, UK, and USA and
opened only sales offices there. In 2012 Project Management offices settled in Sunnyvale. After that headquarters were 
shifted to Berlin for more expansion and grow.

###**Business Model** being used @ Coeus Solutions
Two major business models are being followed here:

####1-  Fixed Priced Model
In fixed-price contracts, the company charges a fixed fee for its software-development services which is usually negotiated
before the start of the project during contract signing. In such contracts, the company effectively bears most of the risk
and therefore expects a relatively higher price from the client. The client, in return, may be willing to pay a higher price
because the company assumes most of the risk.	In this model, Client’s requirements are analyzed thoroughly and then devised
a fixed budget for that project with a fixed deadline. This Business Model is followed usually when requirements are not very
volatile. A little change in requirement can be entertained freely and for a big change, both budget and deadline are extended
accordingly.

#####Characteristics of Fixed Price Model Projects:

 ⋅⋅* Clear scope of project.
 ⋅⋅* Complete set of requirements.
 ⋅⋅* Client and service provider know well each other’s duties and capabilities, skills.

####2-  Time and Material (Cost-Plus/Dedicated developer contract)
This Business Model is also known as cost plus. In this model the developers in Coeus Solutions are dedicated 
to some clients and clients have to pay according to the time and material. In this kind of model requirements are
usually volatile. So, due to this reason there can be a lot of change requests if client is not aware about the
requirement but client must has to pay according to the agreement/contract. Since both company and client are 
typically more closely involved in the day-to-day running of the project,the reasons for price increases are generally
well-known and there are fewer surprises for the client. As the client invests more money in the project, the company
does "whatever it can" to ensure client satisfaction, resulting in a very positive experience for the client. 
However, as project price starts to get out of hand, the client starts to question the ability of company and may
often blame the them. 

#####Characteristics of Time and Material Agreements
 ⋅⋅* Avoid the increased cost and time required for hashing out infinite details of how the app will work.
 ⋅⋅* Reduce the risk of unmet expectations.
 ⋅⋅* Give you the speed and agility to adjust to new information you learn from developing your customer.

###Role of Mr. Ahsan Naseem in Coeus Solutions
Mr. Ahsan Naseem is currently COO (Chief Operating Officer) in Coeus Solutions. He is leading/handling three 
departments which are Human Resources, Accounts and Operations.Mr. Ahsan Naseem is able authorize to change 
if there is need to change in any of these department according to need or according CEO (Chief Executive Officer)
in Coeus Solutions Mr. Ali Naqi Shaheen.

###Tools Used @ Coeus
⋅⋅* Active Collab for project management.
⋅⋅* Github for version control system.
⋅⋅* Operating System used are Windows, Linux (mainly ubuntu) and Mac OS.

Moreover  many other tools are used in company that differs from developer to developer, the type of technology they are 
using for example the IOS development team will Xcode for software testing while web development team will use selenium 
for automated testing while developers working on ruby on rails will be using cabybara or any other tools/framework for 
software testing.


###Software development process
Coeus solutions is very much flexible in using any software development process. The decision that which process 
should be used depends upon the nature of the project. If project demands Rapid Development process to be used 
than this is used or if it requires Agile to be used than agile is used in short any software development process
that is required for suits well with the project is used. In this way Coeus Solutions is very much adaptable when
it comes to choice of a particular software development process. Following development life cycle are at least once
used/exercised at Coeus.

1) Iterative and incremental development.
2) Agile development.
3) Rapid application development.
4) Waterfall development. 


###SAAP vs SAAS
Coeus deals in ‘Software as a Service’ software licensing and delivery model. Everything is written and discussed
in the contract. in SAAS delivery model company will provide for the maintenance of the software over a specific 
period of time. While in SAAP (Software as a Product) company will not provide any maintenance until a new contract
is signed between the two parties. But in Coeus Solutions SAAS is followed and each and every little detail is 
discussed and written in the contract. 


###Coeus Project Lifecycle
First of all the Business manager interacts with the client that what kind of software solutions he/she is asking
for. After that the required product details are sent to the cost estimation team any individual among the team 
owns the responsibility of making the cost estimation of the project. After that this quote given by the cost 
estimation team is sent to sales manager. The sales manager changes/alters the quote if required. After that the 
quote is sent to the client. If everything goes well between the company and the client. A contract is formulated 
according to the mutual concerns of client and company, the nature of project and type of business model selected
by the client. After that at the end the contract is signed by both parties that is one the client and other the
CEO of the company. After that development team starts working on the assignment project.
