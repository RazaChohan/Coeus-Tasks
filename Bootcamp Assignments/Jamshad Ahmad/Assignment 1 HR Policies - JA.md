**Important HR Policies**
Well, pretty much each policy is important to me, it depends on circumstances whether they are applied to me or not.
Still I'm carrying most important of them to me below:

> **Attendence/Office timing policy:**

*	Working days are from Monday to Friday and working time is from 9:00am to 6:00pm.
*	Late sitting is discouraged.
*	We have to put minimum of 40hrs of work per week and so 160hrs for month.
