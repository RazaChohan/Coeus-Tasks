###**AktionsKalendar**
**Overview**: It’s a universal application which tracks/caters particular actions being performed on client’s server. (Pretty similar like Redmine, Jira, etc.) 

**Challenges**: Custom design which took a bit more time than expected, late clarifications of requirement (offline storage which leaded to some API changes) 

###**GuestBook**
**Overview**: It’s an iPad application which allows user to draw things on screen by hand. The purpose of this app is to have frequent feedback from client’s customers. 

**Challenges**: Multiple touches are not easy to handle as it seems to, though we fixed the problem by using private API’s as it’s an enterprise distribution. We build a whole custom Admin panel without help of Web guys.

###**Stromtracker**
**Overview**: It’s a very simple iPhone app to describe and inverse is its implementation. It’s an app built for electric power house in Germany where they will provide this app to their consumers and the consumers will record meter reading after fixed intervals and report the concerned authorities. This is a nice effort to stimulate things instead of doing manually.

**Challenges**: The backbone of this project is image processing, which involves lots of technical knowledge regarding image processing. There were many meters step involved which took a lot of time for its training. We wasted our plenty of time on tesseract and then we moved to a custom algorithm which was termed Template searching.
This app also has a custom graph implementation which we built using Coreplot and it took more time then estimated because of its complex and highly customizability.

###**Atlas Supplier**
**Overview**: It’s a universal application which helps in establishing a connection between supplier and vendor, where supplier can update tickets and its location. It’s a custom implementation of (Redmine, Jira, and sort of portals). User can take breaks, finish, assign, and unassigned tickets and can comments on issue Ps. Can attach images side along. Can receive notifications and much more.
**Challenges**: Custom map implementation is the biggest challenge so far. Rest of the project went pretty smooth.
