***HR Policies***
The policies I like in Coeus Solutions.
1.	Saturday off, as we have to work most of the time on computer machine so it’s a good thing for us that weekends are off. Because completely rest and sports (exercise) is necessary for health as I am badminton player so I’ll get chance to play.

2.	Attendance policy, it’s good for all the employees that attendance is online

3.	Late sitting is discouraged, it’s very good to know that late sitting is discouraged here

4.	Ownership of mobile/laptop, it’s good to know that company provides laptops/mobiles to the employees for the office related work.

5.	Company will bear 100% cost of repairs, it is also good for us to know that in case of any damage to our device during company related work then company will bear 100% of the cost of repairs.

6.	18 PL (privilege leaves), it’s good to know that we can avail 18 PL at the end of year if there is no work or we can accommodate the work.
